# Questions:
## Data Preprocessing
Q: What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    A: Classification

Q: What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    A: Aplication Type, Is_Successful
    
Q: What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    A: EIN, NAME

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
Q: How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    A: For Model_1, I used 3 layers for no particular reason, 100, 30, 1 nodes respectively and 50 epochs and achieved 72.53%

Q: Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    A: It was not possible to achieve or replicate 75% Accuracy.

Q: What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
    A: I increased the layers to 200, 100, 1 node and also increased the epoch number to 200 and attained 72.45%
